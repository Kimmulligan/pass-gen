Random Password Generator

This is a random password generator which allows the user to pick a length between 8-128 characters and lets the user choose all or some of four options for characters: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and specials. 
Once all of the input from the user is submitted, the generator returns a password of the users chosen length which includes only and all of the chosen character types.
